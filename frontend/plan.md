Website - with input 




Notes:


We want to generate a playlist on Spotify/Youtube (let's consider Youtube first).
Youtube: Either host the video on site or generate a queue url (less reliable, but brings user to youtube, so nice UI).

Spotify: no queue link, and embedding/hosting locally/on website will require login (to listen to the whole song).
